# Stats 130
Stats 130 is Getting Up to Speed with SPSS, Stata, SAS, and R, which I took under Professor Cha in Winter of 2017. I have included my 5 homework assignments, one R midterm, and final project. Please do not copy your homework assignments from my code; I have simply posted my solutions to showcase my skills in R. My final grade in the class was an A, however I did not score perfectly on all of the assignments. My grades for the homework assignments, one R midterm, and final report are as follows:

|   Assignment  | Grade  | Median |  Mean  |
----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| HW 1          | 100%   | 100%   | 98%    |
| HW 2          | 95%    | 100%   | 98%    |
| HW 3          | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |
| HW 4          | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |
| HW 5          | 100%   | 95%    | 97%    |
| R Midterm     | 90%    | 98%    | 91%    |
| Final Report  | 100%   | 100%   | 99%    |
